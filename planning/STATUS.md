# Status — 2026-09-23 (v0.1.0, M2 in flight)

## One line

M1 done 2026-09-20 (v0.1.0). M2 infrastructure is up on GCP project
`atlas-rag-rush` — image built, Qdrant Cloud loaded with 4,020 chunks,
secrets and Firestore in place — and stops one command short: the Cloud Run
deploy itself.

## Blocked on you

- [x] ~~Add OpenAI credits~~ → switched to Gemini (2026-09-20). Same AI Studio
      key as sextant, in `atlas/.env` only. Daily spend cap: ₹50–100 across
      both projects — state ₹ before every paid step.
- [x] ~~Revoke the compromised OpenAI key~~ → all keys on the account
      revoked 2026-09-20.
- [x] ~~Revoke the compromised Qdrant Cloud key~~ → cluster deleted
      2026-09-20; key died with it. `.env` uses local Docker Qdrant.
- [ ] **Resume bullets** with M1 numbers (P 0.42 · R 0.78 · F 1.0, 4,021
      chunks) — drafted 2026-09-20, say "apply" to patch `resume_v5a.tex`.
- [ ] **Run the Cloud Run deploy** — the sandbox blocks `gcloud run deploy`:
      `SKIP_BUILD=1 IMAGE_TAG=0fdd0b2 scripts/deploy_gcp.sh`
- [ ] **Billing budget alert** ₹200/mo on `atlas-rag-rush` (console).
- [ ] **DNS** — CNAME for `atlas.hulage.in` once the service URL exists.

## Where things stand

| Area | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ingestion (A) | Done, **proven idempotent live** (uuid5 ids, skip-before-embed) | 6c52438; 155 docs / 4,021 chunks, re-run 0.3 s |
| Hybrid retrieval (B) | Done, dense path proven against real Qdrant local mode | `tests/integration/test_qdrant_roundtrip.py` (90b3432) |
| Orchestration (C) | Done; evidence provenance + per-stage timings exposed | f17a28e |
| Evaluation (D) | **Run live ×4.** Relabelled: P 0.42 · R 0.78 · F 1.00 · AR 0.83 (was 0.31/0.67 with two mislabelled questions; same code, same index) | `eval_data/reports/fastapi-v2-relabel_*.json` |
| API & observability (E) | Done; **daily spend cap** (`BUDGET_DAILY_USD`, 429 past it, `/health.budget`); keys in SQLite or **Firestore** (`AUTH_STORE`) | auth, rate limit, cache, Prometheus, streaming |
| Console | Rebuilt as React app (Vite + shadcn + Motion), cartographic design | baabc6e; `DESIGN.md` |
| Landing | Rebuilt in the same app, served at `/` | 2475b45 |
| Quality gate | ruff + mypy clean, **313 tests** green, 89% cov | `make lint typecheck test` |
| Corpus | Full FastAPI docs: 155 markdown files, ingested into `atlas_default` + `data/index/default/bm25_index.json` | fetch with `--max-files 1000` |
| Deploy | Docker Compose local; **GCP infra live** (`atlas-rag-rush`, image `0fdd0b2` in Artifact Registry, Qdrant Cloud + Firestore + 4 secrets); Cloud Run revision not yet rolled | `docs/deploy.md`, `scripts/deploy_gcp.sh` |
| LLM provider | Gemini via OpenAI-compatible endpoint, verified: embed 1536-d, JSON chat, streaming | `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, 2026-09-20 |

## Measured (2026-09-20, v0.1.0)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Context precision @5 | 0.309 |
| Context recall | 0.667 (5/15 misses; 2 are dataset labels, 3 genuine) |
| Faithfulness | 1.000 |
| Answer relevance | 0.815 / 0.826 (two runs) |
| Latency | p50 ≈7 s uncached (Gemini flash-lite, 5–7 LLM calls); <1 ms cache hit; reranker cold start +5 s |
| Cost | ≈₹0.03 per uncached query; ≈₹1.5 per 15-sample eval |

## Known defects

See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md). Nothing blocks M2. Post-M1 sweep closed six
items: stale tail chunks, manifest noise, eval labels, `--set` overrides,
daily spend cap, console markdown.

## Last three sessions

- 2026-09-23 (M2 infra, ≈₹1) — GCP project `atlas-rag-rush` created and
  billed, five APIs on, Artifact Registry + Firestore in `asia-south1`, four
  Secret Manager secrets (all piped from `.env`, none typed), IAM for the
  compute SA. Image `0fdd0b2` built by Cloud Build (~3 min). Corpus ingested
  into the Qdrant Cloud cluster: **4,020 chunks** (one stale `index.md` tail
  chunk pruned, so cloud and BM25 now agree exactly). Two defects the cloud
  found that local could not: missing payload indexes (Qdrant Cloud 400s
  filtered deletes) and the missing `.gcloudignore` (build lost `data/index/`).
  313 tests. Left to do: `gcloud run deploy`.
- 2026-09-20 (M2 prep, ₹0) — `KeyStore` protocol: SQLite + Firestore
  backends (`AUTH_STORE`), `/keys` reachable before the first key exists
  (was a chicken-and-egg with auth on — found by the image smoke test);
  production Dockerfile (CPU torch, reranker weights + BM25 baked in, `PORT`),
  `scripts/deploy_gcp.sh` + `make deploy-gcp`, Fly config removed,
  `docs/deploy.md` rewritten for Cloud Run. Auth middleware got its first
  tests. Image builds and boots locally (2.15 GB arm64). GCP project not
  yet created — needs a yes.
- 2026-09-20 (later) — **Post-M1 sweep**, ₹0 except two console queries:
  `prune_document` for shrinking docs; unsupported files skipped at ingest;
  fq-002 → `release-notes`, fq-008 += `stream-data`; `run_eval.py --set`
  applies `PipelineConfig.overrides` (`reranker.enabled=false` now exists);
  `BUDGET_DAILY_USD` cap (0.60 locally); console renders answer markdown.
  Eval re-run on relabelled set: P 0.31→0.42, R 0.67→0.78, F 1.0, AR 0.83
  (₹0.3, 156 s). Three genuine misses remain: `tutorial/body`,
  `tutorial/response-model`, `tutorial/security/*` → M3.
- 2026-09-20 — **M1 done.** Gemini via `OPENAI_BASE_URL`; fixed ingest
  idempotency (uuid5), namespace collection/BM25 mismatch, router domain,
  Qdrant image, eval doc-id matching, judge truncation. Full corpus, three
  eval runs, numbers into README/landing/STATUS. Tagged v0.1.0.
- 2026-09-13 — DESIGN.md (cartographic), console rebuilt twice (static HTML
  rejected → React/shadcn/Motion), landing rebuilt, API gained
  evidence/timings/sources endpoints.
- 2026-08-15 — Dense path proven against real Qdrant; `search()` →
  `query_points()`.
- 2026-08-07 / 14 — Dense retrieval repaired, ingest CLI made runnable, lint
  and types cleaned.

## Next

[M2 — Cloud deploy (GCP)](ROADMAP.md#m2--cloud-deploy-gcp), one command from
done. After the revision is live: smoke `/health`, mint the first key with
`X-Admin-Secret`, one live query (≈₹0.02), custom domain, budget alert, then
the landing page states the cold start. Ask before anything billable; budget
in INR.
